            "A research scientist is a scientist who works primarily with gathering knowledge and understanding research. While many scientists are employed in applied scientific fields that involve development and design work, a research scientist typically can be found in academic settings or similar areas. Because these scientists are engaged in pure research work that may not have immediate application in the business or consumer world, they tend to rely on grants and funding from academic and charitable foundations. Research scientists typically perform experiments, make observations, and create detailed papers of their findings for peer review and publishing.",
            "Much of what any research scientist does is based on the fundamentals of the scientific method. Normally under the purview of an academic or research organization's approval, this scientist will create experiments that include both control and experimental groups. He or she will record responses based upon the introduction of a variable into both groups. The research scientist will typically draft a proposal for such experimentation, and he or she may be required to have these proposals reviewed by peers within the field to determine the validity and methodology of the research work.",
            "Most research scientists have advanced university degrees in their target subject, typically having earned post-graduate recognition in their chosen field of study. They normally work in a lab environment, but these environments can vary, depending on the scientific specialty. Psychology labs may simply be a bank of computers, while botanical or zoological labs are set up to safely house living specimens. Research scientists typically work regular daytime hours, but they should expect that travel, field work, and irregular hours may be required from time to time by the particular subject matter of the research performed."

They must work well in a team setting with other departments and (potentially) other analysts, sharing and discussing crucial information to reach all company goals. One of the quality control analyst's main tools is a personal computer with office applications to create documents and spreadsheets containing their findings. They typically report their progress to the quality control supervisor or leader in their organization.",
            "A high school diploma or equivalent is generally required for this position. In addition, previous experience in a quality control or analyst capacity is generally preferred. These professionals should work well under pressure and be able to multitask with minimal supervision. They should also possess advanced analytical, problem solving, and communication skills. Additionally, quality control analysts must have excellent writing skills that facilitate their duties when analyzing production processes. They also must have experience with popular scientific methods for quality analysis."

            "Postdoctoral research associates generally assist tenured professors and/or senior researchers and work in a university environment or laboratory, though they also work independently. They often assist principal investigators in performing experimental investigations; on behalf of principal investigators, they may provide guidance to laboratory technicians and/or support staff.  They may need to utilize recording devices or use statistical procedures for research relevant to their assigned field, and are also required to review quality control of various laboratory techniques.",
            "Postdoctoral research associates must know how to use various automated tools and computerized technology to conduct research. They must also be able to troubleshoot system/equipment issues and call relevant repairmen if necessary. They must always ensure that their work area and all instruments and supply materials are clean and sterile, and they are also responsible for writing reports on their research projects.",
            "Those in this position must be proficient with Microsoft Office products, such as Word, Exel, PowerPoint and Outlook, as they may occasionally be required to conduct presentations; they should also be able to work well in team environments. Employers generally require that candidates have a master's degree or Ph.D.",
            "These research associates may need to interact with clients, so effective oral and written communication skills are important in this position. They must be innovative and dedicated, and are often required to travel to attend conferences or workshops and read professional journals. Some may occasionally be required to work overtime in order to meet deadlines, and some may train and coach new and junior research associates."

Those who work in landscaping or nurseries should be physically-fit in order to keep up with the job's demanding duties. They must also be skilled in working with tools and chemicals like sprinkler systems, garden shears, and fertilizers. Nursery and landscape horticulturists typically learn on the job and require little formal training, while those who work in the science field often need formal education in the form of a Bachelor's and/or Master's degree in Biology or Plant Science.",

They must also be able to communicate with other staff and take directions well from supervisors. The ability to work in all weather conditions and locales is a must, and willingness to work non-traditional hours, such as early in the morning or on weekends, is often necessary. In science-related fields, employees must have experience in research and documentation of plant growth findings.",

            "Microbiologists study the biology of microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa and algae; examples of microbiologists include bacteriologists, virologists, immunologists and clinical microbiologists. They often work in research and development, although they may also instruct students in microbiology if they hold a position at colleges and universities. Their duties include conducting research projects to examine microorganisms, preparing samples for testing (such as through plating, swabbing and/or incubation), recording their findings accurately, and writing reports and research papers on their findings. Microbiologists also supervise biological technicians and other laboratory workers, as well as stay up to date on research and developments within their field.",
            "A bachelor\u2019s degree in microbiology, cell biology or a related field is typically the minimum educational requirement for entry-level microbiologist positions. Additional education may be required or preferred as well; for example, a doctoral degree is often required for positions involving independent research and/or work in a university. Previous experience in a related position is generally required or preferred.",
            "These scientists must be able to use laboratory equipment such as electron microscopes, relevant computer software, stains and weighing equipment, among others. Microbiologists must work well in a team environment, such as in a laboratory with other microbiologists, laboratory technicians and others; they also need to be able to work well on their own with minimal supervision. A strong understanding of proper laboratory techniques - including those related to safety - is needed as well."

            "Analytical chemists are specialized scientists who work to determine the chemical makeup of a variety of substances, both organic and inorganic. They must not only determine what chemical compounds and molecules are contained in a piece of matter, but also the quantities of those chemicals relative to others to discover chemical impurities, analyze unknown samples, and maintain quality control for specific chemical substances and medicines.",
            "Much of an analytical chemist's job is metaphorical to investigative work. The chemist is typically provided a sample which must be broken down and examined in great detail, and he/she may use chemical means to separate the sample into component parts for easier examination. They may also use a variety of instrumentation and tools, such as centrifuges, chromatoscopes, and spectroscopes, to further detail the substantive makeup of a sample down to the molecular level.",
            "Analytical chemists work in a variety of larger fields. Pharmaceutical companies, for example, employ them to perform quality control work and analyze medicines and drugs to ensure they adhere to formula parameters. They may also work in environmental fields to analyze soil and groundwater samples for potential contaminants and sources. Analytical chemistry is also valuable in food manufacturing, engineering, and even police investigation work.",
            "A strong education background in chemical engineering and chemistry science is generally required for this position, and the field is competitive enough that many employees prefer those who have a master's degree. Most analytical chemists work in a laboratory environment and must be methodical, logical, patient, and proficient in using computers and advanced technology."

            "A counseling psychologist is a mental health professional who works with patients to improve their mental, behavioral and emotional health. They use psychological techniques in their therapy sessions to help patients with issues such as anxiety, depression and interpersonal conflicts. In addition, counseling psychologists also provide assessment and diagnosis - as well as participate in treatment - for more severe psychological symptoms. Some specific duties performed by a counseling psychologist include undertaking risk assessments, planning and implementing therapy, evaluating the outcome of therapy sessions and keeping accurate, up-to-date patient records. These professionals provide clients with a safe place to discuss their issues, as well as offer stress management and coping strategies.",
            "The counseling psychologist's working environment may be a mental health clinic, hospital, school or psychiatric facility, among other settings. Their co-workers include other counseling psychologists, medical doctors, school counselors and psychiatrists; they interact with clients on a daily basis. Counseling psychologists typically work during regular business hours, although their work hours may vary depending on their employer's and clients' needs.",
            "Counseling psychologists must have a bachelor's degree in psychology or a related social science. Most have a master's degree or higher in clinical psychology or related field, and many states require a doctoral degree and license to practice.
