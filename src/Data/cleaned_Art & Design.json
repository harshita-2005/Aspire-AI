            "Graphic designers use color, illustrations, fonts, and layout to visually communicate a message or present a product. They design logos, product packaging, print materials, and websites, among many other things. Graphic designers are found in a variety of industries and in different capacities. For instance, a designer might be employed as in-house staff for a company to work on promotional materials for the organization, or a designer might work for a design agency with many clients and projects. Newspapers, advertising firms, technology-oriented companies, and other organizations commonly employ designers. Additionally, many graphic designers are self-employed, working as independent contractors on a per-project basis.",
            "Most work in an office environment in front of a computer, though some work primarily by hand at a drafting table. Because graphic design often is deadline-driven, designers frequently work long hours. Most graphic designers specialize in one or two areas, such as print, web design, poster design, or corporate identity. Graphic designers are not always required to have completed any specific education, though it is common for designers to hold degrees from an art school or other undergraduate institution. They must have knowledge of design elements, such as color, typography, and composition, as well as the artistic sensibility to effectively use these elements. Graphic designers need excellent communication skills and be able to effectively present ideas visually and verbally to internal stakeholders, clients, and intended audiences. Since most graphic design is created using software such as Adobe Illustrator and InDesign, graphic designers must possess technical skills."

In addition, these designers are in charge of the design process from the mockup stage to the final product, whether it is a poster or a software application. Industrial design concepts are needed to create prototypes and simple, clean designs.",

They also need to create documentation of every step in the design process and increase the usability of ongoing projects. A user experience designer can work as part of team or alone. They typically report to the UX (User Experience) manager and work in an office setting during regular business hours. They use a personal computer with professional-grade software such as Adobe applications as their main tools.",

The senior user experience designer starts with a solid understanding of human cognitive science; by understanding how human beings think and operate, the designer can determine the broad framework for how the user experience should be for the company's product. These senior professionals work with the design team to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to demonstrate interaction and design concepts. Senior designers then help implement the interaction and design concepts into the company product by working alongside the product engineers. Finally, the senior user experience designer works with product managers to continually pursue customer satisfaction with usability studies and testing.",

Senior user experience testers must have excellent usability and visual design skills . They must know industry best practices for web application design, PC application design, and usability. Additionally, senior user experience designers must be capable leaders who can motivate the design team to follow the senior designer's vision and follow through on delivery. Finally, the senior user experience designer must be diplomatic and capable of resolving disputes in a responsible manner as conflicts with the product engineers can arise."

            "When a variety of entities are in their design phases, from buildings and parks to creative works like movies and video games, a concept artist plays a vital and important role. These highly-creative individuals help sketch out ideas of how completed projects will look, which include rough drawings and outlines such as storyboards for films or cartoons, or may help architects and building designers secure bids or help advertising agencies make pitches to clients. Overall, they create concrete visualizations of ideas which can be built, developed, and improved in all sorts of ways.",
            "While there are clearly many applications for concept artists, artistic skill is often the primary qualification. They will generally keep and update portfolios of work they have performed in the past, and these examples are typically utilized in the interview process for various positions. Many concept artists will specialize in building work, advertising development, games, cartoons, or other specific disciplines.",
            "Also important is the ability to derive the essential elements of the concept for which they are responsible. This requires the artist to listen carefully, take notes, ask questions, and refer to design documents and rough preliminary sketches. Those in this position must have a strong understanding of the expectations for their art and tailor their work around those goals, and will share their progress with supervisors to ensure it matches what has been envisioned.",
            "There are a variety of requirements which vary by employer for this position. Some employers hire based on demonstrated skill in a portfolio, while others prefer those with previous experience and successful bids or projects. Many concept artists seek post-secondary training, especially those who will be expected to use graphic and computer tools on the job. Those in this position generally work traditional daytime hours in a design studio environment."

            "A furniture designer is a profession that can include both artistic flair and in-depth understanding of industrial function in conceiving and introducing designs. Employers of furniture designers may use them in wide roles; for instance, a home furnishings company may employ a furniture designer to create furniture with creative and decorative elements for homeowners. Some designers also work for furniture companies which create chairs and desks for classrooms or office/cubicle use. In this latter case, furniture designers are tasked with seeking function over form.",
            "In either case, the main tool of a furniture designer is computer-assisted drawing software, or CAD; such programs are industry-standard across a variety of conceptual disciplines, including furniture design. Using the program, the designer can experiment with various design prototypes and drawings that incorporate required specs and elements. They typically work with a project manager to help establish parameters for designs, but may also consult with a decorator. In some high-end furnishing companies, the designer may earn the right to a great deal of creative freedom within particular product lines. Part of the furniture design process also involves materials, including the use of particular patterned fabrics and colors for upholstered furniture items, as well as weight-bearing considerations, exposed supports, and the use of certain woods, metals, and plastics in the fabrication process.",
            "Many furniture designers have pursued training through technical schools or community colleges in using CAD, as well as apprenticeships and internships for furniture companies. Most furniture designers work in a design workshop atmosphere, which typically combines computers and work materials. Furniture designers usually work during traditional business hours."

After testing is complete, modifications should be introduced and more testing will be carried out until the product reaches its best form.

            "Teams that create drawings, backgrounds, lettering, or other original graphics for commercial purposes work in graphic design. A senior graphic designer is often the leader of such teams, and he or she may have one or more junior graphic designers and other support personnel working with him or her. The senior graphic designer typically will be the member of the team who receives the various jobs to be performed and works out the parameters, requirements, and scope of the design. While the designer will normally perform much of this work, he or she will also delegate graphic work to other junior graphic designers on the team, typically suggesting edits to work and giving final approval before their work is submitted.",
            "In order to have a career as a senior graphic designer, a person typically must have extensive experience working in that field at junior or freelance levels. Most people interested in this job will seek out some kind of training after high school, especially education that involves the fundamentals of computer-aided drawing. Some of these designers attend art school or have an associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degree in design or a related field. Senior graphic designers typically work regular business hours of the week, although projects approaching deadline can cause them to work extended hours."

            "A fashion designer creates designs for items like clothing, shoes, and accessories. Prior to creating a prototype, the designer will create a sketch of the clothing. Usually, this clothing concept will then be presented to management, who will approve the clothing so that a prototype can be created. The fashion designer will often be expected to have sewing skills, in order to create the first clothing example. When the design is handed over to a factory or other clothing producer, the designer must oversee the process to make sure that the clothing meets quality standards of the company. ",
            "It is important to have strong knowledge of various fabrics, in order to make sure that the clothing is durable and comfortable. Sometimes, the fashion designer will be expected to showcase the designs in a fashion show, in order to present fashion concepts to creative directors, as well as consumers. It is important to be familiar with various design software, including computer-aided design programs.",
            "The fashion designer will usually have to demonstrate a portfolio prior to being hired, in order to make sure that the designer\u2019s fashion sense is in line with the company\u2019s vision. Keeping up with trends in the field is important, so that colors and styles can be matched with consumer preferences. Some companies require experience. Internship positions are often available and may be unpaid or paid. Often, any positions within the design field are highly competitive, including internship positions. Some positions require that the designer has graduated from a fashion design program, while others will simply rely on the talent and experience of the fashion designer."

Other tasks led by a creative director commonly include helping with the casting of a commercial, developing radio commercials, and helping guide copywriters and graphic designers on a wide variety of projects.",

An in-house creative director is generally in charge of marketing campaigns or other creative tasks for large companies, whereas an agency creative director handles creative projects for a larger number of clients. Creative directors typically work full time in an office setting, although their hours and work environment may vary by position.",

They also need to be able to move ideas throughout the entire development process from brainstorming to completion, and additional skills relevant to their specific position (such as proficiency with relevant computer programs and industry-specific knowledge) may be required or preferred as well."

            "Animators work by creating cartoons, usually through hand drawings, motion capture animation, or with computers. In the modern era, most animators use a range of computer programs, though sufficient knowledge of basic animation is still absolutely necessary.",
            "Animation is used for games, films, television shows, and commercials. Animators are often expected to create both 2D and 3D animations using storyboarding, and it's important to be familiar with a variety of animation programs and software, such as Maya 3DSMax, Flash, and Morpheme. Character creation is often an important part of the position, and animators may need to be skilled in rigging, scripting, and modeling. Both full-time and part-time positions are available, and some even work freelance. Animators usually work on teams with other artists and marketing experts in order to plan and visualize concepts.",
            "Animators must be creative individuals who can develop and contribute to unique and intriguing concepts. Much of the work is done independently, so it's important to be able to adhere to deadlines; however, communication and teamwork skills are also important in order to collaborate on projects from start to finish. Animation itself is evolving and improving all the time, so it's extremely important to stay up-to-date with all changes and developments in the field. A bachelor\u2019s degree in art, animation, or a related field may be required by some employers."

There are many specialties in the world of textile design, and an individual designer may focus on one or more of them. Some options include dresses, shirts, pants, men's formal apparel, and children's apparel.",
            "Textile design generally involves both the creation of new and original designs for apparel, and the implementation of designs provided by customers. This involves working with graphic design software to manipulate and modify images which will eventually be translated into articles of clothing. A textile designer will work on a project from conception all the way through completion of the physical product.",
            "A bachelor's degree in graphic design is generally required for this position, as well as relevant job experience. One to five years of direct experience in the field is usually preferred, but any design experience is likely to be considered. Training in embroidery, silk screen technology, weaving, and textile manufacture is beneficial, as well.",
            "Like many design-related jobs, textile design is generally done on Mac computers using Adobe software. Strong proficiency with OS X and the Adobe Suite of CS6 programs is required, and ideal candidates should also have excellent communication and presentation skills, and work well independently or with a team.",
            "Textile designers generally work during business hours, but may occasionally be required to work nights or weekends to meet deadlines on important jobs. This generally means Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm. Work is done in an office environment and typically supervised by a department manager."

Communication skills are beneficial for working with models, make-up artists, and clients alike.",

            "A senior art director is usually a graphic design professional with many years of experience in their field. However, the \u201csenior\u201d portion of their title may only indicate this individual is in charge of a team of more junior designers. Regardless of whether he or she leads a team, a senior art director generally spends most of their time developing and implementing creative solutions to various types of graphic design problems. For example, they may design web sites, retouch photos for magazine covers, or create business-specific materials such as logos, business cards, brochures, and price lists. The type of materials they design and create depends largely on the company for which they work. Senior art directors are hired by a wide range of organizations, from video game houses to financial services firms to nonprofit institutions.",
            "If the senior art director leads a team, then a certain portion of their time involves tasks such as mentoring junior design team members and providing feedback on their designs. They may or may not be responsible for periodic performance reviews and only sometimes have input into their team members' compensation levels.",
            "Most companies prefer senior art directors to have a bachelor's degree in graphic design, as well as five to 10 years' experience in a related industry. Some companies want a potential employee to demonstrate their proficiency with a specific software program by holding a certification, particularly Adobe products such as InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator."

Product design managers spend a great deal of the work day coordinating with other teams on projects and directing general operations, product testing, and quality assurance. Product design managers may also propose budgets for upcoming projects. The most important attribute for a product design manager is the ability to coordinate and plan projects, keeping their work group in line with the predetermined goals and deadlines.",

Additionally, they may need to communicate directly with contractors and suppliers of equipment and materials. Product design managers are hired by many different kinds of firms, although the majority of product design managers work in manufacturing and architectural engineering.",

            "A tattoo artist applies permanent artwork to people\u2019s bodies with the use of needles. The tattoo artist should always comply with health codes. It is important to keep the facility and materials clean and sterilized. Some tattoo artists do freelance work, while others work for a company. Prior to being hired by a company, it will usually be necessary to present a portfolio and demonstrate work. Many tattoo artists will work on commission. Some tattoo shops will offer an apprenticeship for a tattoo artist to learn the skills needed for the job. This job may have lower or no pay.",
            "Before applying tattoos to the body, the artist will usually create a drawing based on the desires of the customer. The customer may describe a concept or may have an image ready for the tattoo artist. The tattoo artist should also keep a collection of images and fonts for a customer to choose from if the client does not have a preexisting idea. Then the tracing of the image or letters is transferred onto the customer\u2019s body, which is followed with a tattoo needle. Once the tattoo is done, the tattoo artist will instruct the customer as to how to care for the tattoo. Retouching services may be offered for any spots that may have been missed or were not colored to the client\u2019s satisfaction.",
            "Strong customer service skills are important so that customers provide good reviews and will come back for future work. Some tattoo artists will focus on a certain area, such as letter or portrait work. Some tattoo artists will also have other body art duties, such as piercings. There aren\u2019t usually any specific education requirements for this position, although some kind of art schooling can be helpful."

            "Product designers are responsible for designing and developing the majority of the consumer products that people use in their everyday lives. All industries that manufacture consumer products employ product designers. For example, product designers work in electronics, furniture design, general manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, and many other fields. More specialized fields include medical technology and telecommunications device manufacturing. While many product designers work to meet consumer needs with completely new products, many of the product designers' job responsibilities involve improving existing designs. Design improvement may be needed for a variety of reasons, such as improvement of functionality, improvement of appearance, and manufacturing cost reductions.",
            "Often, product designers work as members of multidisciplinary teams that include engineers, prototype fabricators, executive sales staff members, marketing and advertising team members, and others.  As part of the design process, product designers employ a variety of technologies, including computer assisted design (CAD), drawings and blueprints, and 3D modeling. Product designers must have working knowledge of these technologies, as well as manufacturing methods, available materials, and budgetary and time considerations.",
            "Product designers usually work full time in an office environment. They may be freelance workers who contract with companies or full-time employees. In addition to working in offices, product designers make frequent use of workshops, studios, and even factory space to aid the design process. Additional responsibilities include meeting with customers or co-workers to discuss designs and commercial needs, working as part of the design team, learning about new manufacturing technologies and materials, researching products and how to improve them, producing models or drawings, and working with engineers to produce prototypes.",
            "Most employers require their product designers to hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in a related field, and relevant work experience is generally preferred."

As senior designers, they also must communicate observations on trends to the fashion designers working beneath them, as the senior designer holds a managerial position as well.",
            "To reach a senior fashion designer position, one must demonstrate a mastery of all the design skills held by lower-level designers; even after reaching the senior level, senior designers still use their design skills regularly. Regardless of what is being designed, which may include all forms of clothing, shoes, and accessories, hand-sketching of designs and computer aided drafting (CAD) are required to communicate their vision to other designers and create a blueprint of the product to be created. Additionally, a senior fashion designer must be able to analyze the work of designers they oversee, modifying blueprints to produce an end product. Strong communication skills are essential in this position, as it will often to be necessary to communicate the adjustments necessary to bring designs to life in a timely, cost-efficient manner.",
            "Apart from the mastery of skills and experience necessary to become a senior fashion designer, many have a bachelor\u2019s degree in fashion design, art, graphic design, or a related field, as well as internship experience with more experienced designers. Generally, fashion designers work indoors in studios, offices, and workshops; senior fashion designers regularly leave the actual design area to meet with upper management within their companies and clients for whom they are working on designs."

            "Video games are more popular than ever, partially due to the rise in cell phone use over the past decade, and new mobile games are released almost every day. Video game artists are responsible for planning and designing these games using extensive programming knowledge and creating virtual environments in which people are challenged, but still have fun. They must be able to tell cohesive stories, create amazing visuals, and do so in ways that keep players coming back for more.",
            "The design aspect of gaming can be quite complex for video game artists.  They must be able to create paintings as concept art, design architectural drawings, create vector and bitmap-based icons, and more. They usually work in teams to develop their ideas together, and it is essential that all team members communicate effectively with one another to keep projects running smoothly. They also work with writers to ensure that a game's artwork and visual style matches the original script, and they must be prepared to bring words to life with the combination of art and programming.",
            "Video game artists usually develop their skills at an art or technical school, including everything from painting and color theory to user interface design. They can then create a portfolio of projects for potential employers in the future. These artists often obtain further employment based on the strength and diversity of their portfolios, and some positions also require a bachelor's degree while others require specific certifications."

            "2D animators utilize a blend of personal creativity and task-specific computer programs to produce visual images which convey the appearance of moving; this differs from 3D animation, which adds depth to the mix. Simply put, 2D animators produce cartoons and similar animations which have a \u201cflat\u201d look to them, such as TV shows and movies like The Simpsons, The Flintstones, anime, and others.",
            "To create two-dimensional images, a series of detailed but similar images must be produced, which when assembled flow smoothly as a cartoon or similar visual image with fluid movement. While it is a detailed and time-consuming process, the end result is a video that can thrill, entertain, educate, and affect audiences in many other ways. This involves four key elements: development, pre-production, production, and post-production. In the first two, the focus is on developing and improving the storyline and concept. The images themselves are created during the production stage, and the fine-tuning and special effects are added in the post-production stage.",
            "Creating the images themselves requires creativity and skill. Some 2D animators work by painstakingly drawing and painting each individual image, which was the norm before the days when computers could be used. While some are still hand-drawn, most 2D animators work with specialized computer programs, changing and fine-tuning each image as needed along the way. As such, strong computer skills and a mastery of the programs used are necessary for this position, and 2D animators must stay up-to-date with all changes and updates in computer programs and other relevant technology.",
            "Working hours for 2D animators can vary, ranging from a part-time position in front of a computer to many long hours of overtime, especially as deadlines approach. This is also determined by whether the animator works for a large production company or on contracts within specific time-frames.",
            "Generally speaking, those in this position have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in graphic design, animation, film production, or a related field, and must have strong creative skills, well-developed computer skills, and stay up-to-date with all changes in software and other areas impacting their positions.

            "A 3D animator uses computer software to create vivid, engaging video animations that can be used for web design applications, computer games, commercials, and full-length movies and television programs. 3D animators typically work with developers, designers, and directors, making initial sketches and helping create quickly sketched stills of the work to be done (called storyboards). Working in close consultation with these supervisory developers or designers, the animator then uses professional drawing and animation programs to model characters, backgrounds, and movements on screen. The animator develops a shading strategy and works to create movement of the elements on screen to make them match the designer's intent and in a way that is consistent with the storyboards created earlier in the process.",
            "In an animation or video design studio, 3D animators traditionally work as members of an animation team. Animators must be able to collaborate and work well with one another to create a cohesive piece of animation that fits the overall project. Animators typically have deadlines for their work and are expected to work efficiently and promptly report difficulties that might extend deadlines.",
            "The educational requirements to work as a 3D animator are typically flexible. Many employers require a portfolio of work and a resume with extensive practical experience in the field. Individuals interested in this line of work can take vocational, technical, and university classwork in this area."

Some may be tasked with maintaining and utilizing 3D printers to create different tools, and much of this work is done on a computer to program devices to mold plastic and metals together and create complex tools with unique solutions for problems. This work is usually carried out in groups, but may also be performed independently, and they must be able to read instrument gauges for measurements and lift at least 50 pounds.",
            "Industrial tool designers should have prior programming and design experience, particularly in geometric dimensions and tolerance, and prior experience with engineering using CNC machines is highly beneficial. Flexibility is important to respond directly to the needs of customers, and the frequency of individual jobs can vary over time. They must be highly familiar with applied mathematics and new engineering techniques in their ever-changing fields, and due to the influx of new materials being implemented in creating modern industrial tools, an up-to-date understanding of new techniques and the evolution of CNC machinery is highly recommended."
