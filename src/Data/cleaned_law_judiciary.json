The corporate lawyer may be responsible for helping establish a new corporation, which requires filing articles of incorporation and adhering to all relevant federal, state, and local regulations. Once a corporation has been established, corporate lawyers give advice on its business transactions with other entities and provide advice about regulations, licensing of new technologies, and managomg all legal disputes regarding operations.  Corporate lawyers are also responsible for providing advice and planning related to corporate mergers, acquisitions, and other large-scale strategic deals.",
            "Corporate lawyers typically work in an office environment during regular business hours, although there is a high likelihood of overtime due to the demanding and fast-paced corporate atmosphere, especially when major deals, acquisitions, or restructurings occur.  Corporate lawyers work closely with other members of the legal team, such as trademark and patent lawyers, to ensure the legality of all aspects of corporate operations.  They meet with regulatory agencies to negotiate and ensure compliance with laws and other regulations.  They also advise upper management on corporate strategy and regulatory issues.  Some travel is required to meet with regulators, as well as observe and advise at satellite corporate offices and sites.",

Often simply called a litigator, they oversee the entire process of taking a lawsuit to court. This process is quite often lengthy, and it is necessary for the litigation attorney to be patient and detail-oriented.",
            "To start the process, the litigation attorney must investigate the case to find out whether enough evidence exists to create a potential lawsuit (in the case of their client suing somebody else); if the client is being sued, the litigator will investigate evidence pertaining to the case. There are two types of litigation attorneys: civil and criminal. Criminal litigators focus on state or federal prosecutions, and civil litigators have a broad range of case types they may work on. Often, a litigator chooses to specialize in a particular area such as business, real estate, or personal injury. The lawsuits that litigators work on may vary widely in scope, and they may require the litigator to have a team of co-attorneys and other legal staff.",
            "The required credentials for a litigator are a juris doctorate from an accredited law school and pass the bar exam in the state in which they want to practice, the same requirements as for any other lawyer. Usually, litigators can be classed by their experience in dealing with lawsuits, measured in years. A junior litigator has zero to three years, a mid-level litigator has three to four, and a senior litigator has four or more."

            "Trial lawyers handle many of the functions of an attorney, and although they do argue cases in court, this is only a small percentage of their work on a daily basis. Due to ever-rising costs and court fees, trial lawyers should expect to do the majority of their work outside of the courtroom, fill out a variety of court-related documents, spend weeks and months reviewing potential clients and witnesses to interview, and meeting with other attorneys to discuss potential settlements for cases. Trial lawyers are also responsible for selecting jurors should their case go to trial, and they must always stay up-to-date with current laws and changes to laws as they occur. Strong verbal and written communication skills are also essential in this position.",
            "Aspiring trial lawyers must have education in several key areas, such as criminal, courtroom, property, and constitutional law, and they must also study contract negotiations and civil and criminal procedures. They should have at least a bachelor's degree and have taken and passed both the LSAT and bar exam after completing law school, and many also continue their education throughout their careers as new laws and changes in court procedures are implemented throughout the country each year."

            "Prosecutors, or prosecuting attorneys, are licensed lawyers who appear in courts of law on behalf of the government. They may represent the United States or work at a state or local level, and their cases are usually against people accused of illegal activity.",
            "Their work begins by researching and investigating specific cases. They will make contact with police, as well as any witnesses, victims, and alleged perpetrators to gather evidence which could later be used to build a case. Next, they will determine whether there is sufficient evidence for the matter to be brought to court. In some cases, the process will end here; for example, if a minor crime is committed and the perpetrator confesses, the prosecutor may issue a fine and forgo a trial. If action is initiated, there will be an in-court trial in which the prosecutor must attempt to establish the suspect's guilt by presenting evidence and questioning him/her, as well as witnesses and various experts.",
            "Prosecutors generally work in offices, the size of which may determine the nature of their work. Those who represent large municipalities may specialize in particular areas of law, such as traffic offenses, while those in smaller offices may handle all aspects of law. They frequently interact with other lawyers and government employees, as well as police and various experts of criminal justice.",
            "Prosecutors typically work regular office hours. Like all lawyers, they are required to have completed a bachelor's degree, followed by three years of law school, and passing the bar exam administered by their state."

Patent agents may work for a variety of employers, including universities, law firms, corporations such as pharmaceutical and engineering firms, and private individuals.",
