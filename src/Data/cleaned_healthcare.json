            "Certified nurse assistants (CNAs) provide care to patients, often in facilities such as nursing homes. They generally assist patients with basic needs, such as bathing, dressing, mobility, positioning, eating, and grooming, among other things. They often care for multiple patients who have a variety of health needs and personal abilities, so it is important for nurse assistants to be knowledgeable of the types of care which should be administered and sensitive to the needs of individual patients.",
            "There are both full-time and part-time positions available for certified nurse assistants. Some may need to have flexible schedules, as it may occasionally be necessary to work nights and/or weekends, and strong customer service and people skills are important in order to help patients feel at ease. CNAs often work within large networks of medical providers, so communication with other staff is important in order to provide up-to-the-minute care for patients. When changes in patients' statuses are noted, CNAs should report these to the doctor or nurse in charge.",
            "This job often requires great physical strength, as CNAs will be walking and standing for most of their shifts as they make rounds and tend to patients. The ability to lift heavy objects is important, as they often help patients from place to place. In addition to caring for patients, they should also ensure that the environment is clean and tidy by performing basic housekeeping tasks. Education, training, and current valid certification are required to become a certified nurse assistant."

            "Medical laboratory technicians perform standard medical lab tests such as blood tests, immunoassays, and cultures. They must be able to work independently to take lab tests and interpret patient results. They also must work with other health care professionals, such as doctors and nurses, to solve medical problems. Additionally, they are responsible for phlebotomy work, which includes the collection and preparation of patient samples, such as blood, urine, or stool. They must observe patient confidentiality protocols, as they are often working with sensitive personal information.",
            "Outside of patient responsibilities, these technicians are also responsible for ensuring the equipment inside the lab works properly by periodically calibrating and testing it. They are also expected to know how to troubleshoot problematic equipment, evaluate new laboratory methods and equipment, and train new assistants and technicians on current operations.",
            "Candidates for medical laboratory technician positions must be able to function in a stressful environment, be prepared to take on shifts at any time of the day or night, and be prepared to work periodic overtime. Flexibility with hours is particularly important at facilities staffed around the clock, such as hospitals. In addition, the candidate must be physically able to remain on their feet for most of the day, and be prepared to lift and carry lab samples or equipment from one location to another. They must also have good interpersonal skills, as they must interact with patients and their families on a day-to-day basis. It is also helpful to have strong leadership skills, as technicians will most likely supervise laboratory assistants and must be comfortable with delegating tasks and organizing work low.",
            "In most laboratories, an associate's degree is necessary, most preferably in clinical laboratory technology (CLT) or a medical laboratory technology (MLT) program. In addition, candidates must either have, or be willing to obtain, national accreditation. Two appropriate certification options include the American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP) or the National Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA). As for experience, the minimum is one to two years in a related field, and three to five years in microbiology or a similar field is preferred."

            "Anesthesiologists play an important role in a variety of surgical procedures, as they are responsible for carefully administering general or local anesthetics to patients while monitoring them closely. When using general anesthetics, they must carefully watch all vital signs at all times and communicate this information to the surgeon; for localized anesthetics, they must maintain communication with patients and monitor their comfort levels throughout what are typically out-patient procedures.",
            "Most general anesthetics are now administered to patients through an existing IV tube. Just before surgical procedures, anesthesiologists will begin to carefully add the sleep-inducing drugs to the IV solution, and throughout surgery they will carefully monitor vital signs, such as heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure. In some cases, they may continue to introduce anesthetics to maintain the patient's unconsciousness. Throughout the procedure, they must also carefully watch the body of the patient to ensure that he/she remains perfectly still.",
            "When administering a local anesthetic, an anesthesiologist's job is to find the proper position on the affected area for surgery and carefully numb all nerve endings within that area. This is typically done with an injection, but the anesthesiologist must carefully find the proper site and may need to administer more than one shot for full effects. As the procedure continues, the anesthesiologist stays in contact with the patient and and monitors discomfort levels through this feedback and visual observation.",
            "Anesthesiologists are licensed and certified physicians, and this career field has the same rigorous training requirements in undergraduate studies, medical school, and residency as many other physician specialties. They work primarily on complex and lengthy surgeries which require precision and experience, and typically work daytime hours unless practicing at a hospital with more extensive surgical hours."

They can provide dietary plans for persons wanting to lose weight, specific training suggestions for athletes, and guidance to patients who may require nutritional help because of chronic diseases or treatments.",

In these cases, the person and the nutritionist will identify the goals that the diet is meant to achieve. These can be as simple as losing weight, or they can involve assisting patients to get proper nutrients during treatments like chemotherapy. The nutritionist will work to help plan meals and provide education and knowledge to help the person meet their individual goals.",

Many institutions, especially hospitals, are likely to require postgraduate degrees as well. Nutritionists typically work in an office environment, but they may also spend time in industrial kitchens, as well as working with clients in their own homes or in clinical office settings."

When the practitioner is unsure of a diagnosis, the patient may be referred to another doctor. General practitioners also provide care such as managing wounds, infections, and injuries. Patients may be advised regarding test results and how they can improve their health at home through plans relating to diet, exercise, and care specific to their ailments.",

Medication should be administered to patients as necessary, and the medication should not interfere with any allergies or other problems the patient may have.",

It may sometimes be necessary to communicate with other healthcare providers of patients to solve any problems that may arise. Some management skills are also necessary in order to oversee nurses and physician assistants, and interpersonal skills are important to help patients feel at ease. Proper hygiene and care must be displayed at all times according to company policies and local and federal laws."

            "A pathologist is a clinical specialist whose role is akin to being a detective for medical conditions. He or she analyzes samples of tissues, fluids, or other pertinent hard data related to a patient and then reports findings to the primary physician. Sometimes a pathologist offers recommendations for treatment. Pathologists also typically work with doctors performing autopsies  to determine the cause of death.",
            "In most cases, the pathologist will generate some sort of report of the work performed. The report may simply include pertinent data. For instance, an autopsy may conclude that a patient suffered from a condition or perhaps had external factors such as drugs or other agents that contributed to death. In more intricate cases, the pathologist may detail his or her analysis to the primary care physician, indicate possibilities and probabilities, and suggest avenues to pursue for treatment.",
            "To be a pathologist, a person must first graduate from an accredited medical school after completing undergraduate work. Most pathologists specialize in this area of concentration during their education and post-graduate residency. This work is highly selective, and most pathologists rarely interact with patients in person. They perform most of their work in a laboratory setting. Pathologists typically work long hours during the week, although larger clinics and hospitals may have a pathology department that works weekends and extended hours as well."

In many jurisdictions, a PA is licensed to perform routine diagnoses and to write prescriptions.",

The PA normally assesses the situation and then treats the patient, according to medically accepted standards and practices. The PA may determine that the patient requires more specific care and will bring in a physician to escalate the care. A PA can perform regular procedures, such as stitching up minor cuts and setting small fractures or breaks. The PA may also assist a physician in preliminary prep work on patients.",
            "To be a PA, a person must normally have a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology or a similar field. He or she may also need a post-graduate education that is similar to, but not quite as stringent as, that required by regular physicians. The PA must also pass board certification exams and keep these licenses up-to-date through any required continuing education.

The next step is to give the patient recommendations for further testing and treatments and to give advice to the patient\u2019s general physician. The audiologist may recommend that the patient undergo surgery or that the patient uses hearing aids, and a referral may be provided for this hearing equipment or surgery. The audiologist may also recommend that the patient follow up with an ear, nose, and throat doctor. An audiologist may also perform routine screenings, such as hearing tests for infants and children. It is important to be familiar and comfortable with medical terminology, especially relating to audiology.",

The audiologist must be familiar with audiology testing equipment and be able to adapt quickly to changes in equipment. Prior experience in a similar position is often needed, along with proper certification. A master\u2019s degree in audiology is usually needed. Most positions are full-time and are carried out in a medical environment such as a hospital, private practice, or clinic."

A general surgeon often does not have a specialty as to the type of surgery they perform; this is in contrast to specialists such as neurosurgeons or orthopedic surgeons, who perform a limited range of surgeries but typically have a much deeper knowledge of their particular area of specialty. Most surgeons begin their careers as a general surgeon before specializing further.",
            "A surgeon generally spend most of their time planning and performing surgeries, medical procedures that involve cutting into a patient to diagnose and/or repair internal medical problems. General surgeons perform basic procedures and can often be observed performing surgeries such as an appendectomy.",
            "General surgeons most often work for a hospital as part of the hospital's staff or as a private practice caregiver. A general surgeon performs their surgeries in a hospital operating room, and many work shifts that are more than 12 hours long. General surgeons spend many hours on their feet and must have excellent dexterity in their arms and hands.",
            "General surgeons are highly trained individuals who have attended medical school after the completion of a bachelor's degree. Medical school is followed by a residency program in which a general surgeon is trained further so that they are eventually qualified and skilled enough to perform surgeries on their own."

Many parents turn to them for advice regarding physical or mental issues with children, which range from diet to psychological or behavioral diagnoses. Pediatricians also assess these areas when seeing patients and offer recommendations and assistance to parents who may need a greater understanding of the circumstances.",

Still, their primary focus is on the welfare and general health of young adults and kids, and they typically focus on early detection of potential problems to recognize and treat them as early as possible. Because of the unique aspects of child care and parent-assurance, general pediatricians should have excellent people skills and good bedside manner for working with children.",

They use cardiac catheterization to diagnose and treat certain conditions, as well as perform procedures to open blocked vessels to allow normal perfusion using stents, balloons and other devices. Other tasks that the invasive cardiologist may perform include emergent angioplasty, pacemaker and defibrillator insertion, and cardiac ablation. Invasive cardiologists must work effectively with patients, as well as other members of the medical staff; they also need to be able to maintain accurate medical records, as well as follow all relevant privacy laws and rules of their institution.",
            "Invasive cardiologists generally work in a hospital setting with a wide variety of medical colleagues. Their hours may vary depending on the employer and position. Generally, invasive cardiologists are expected to be on call a certain number of times per month, which can be overnight or 24 hours on-call; they may be expected to be in the hospital during those periods.",
            "To qualify for invasive cardiologist positions, an applicant needs to have a medical degree from an accredited medical school. Next, they need to be board certified in both internal medicine and cardiology. In addition, they must be board certified or board eligible in interventional cardiology."

            "An OB/GYN is a medical physician with advanced training, knowledge and certification in the specialty care area of obstetrics and gynecology. OB/GYNs provide healthcare services to women throughout the lifespan, including preventative services, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of reproductive abnormalities. The OB/GYN must complete a thorough examination and medical history of the patient. The OB/GYN not only focuses on illness, but also health promotion, and provides patient education on weight loss, diet, exercise, personal hygiene and preventative care for diseases and cancer. The OB/GYN provides gynecological care to women of any age, as well as obstetrical care and family planning to females of reproductive age. An extensive knowledge of both normal and abnormal conditions related to pregnancy and fertility is required. The OB/GYN is skilled gynecological and obstetrical surgical procedures, such as cesarean sections. OB/GYNs may attend deliveries and provide care to the postpartum mother and newborn. OB/GYNs may supervise mid-level providers such as certified nurse midwives, and assistive personnel such as medical assistants. To become an OB/GYN is a vigerous process. One must first complete a 4-year degree for entry into a medical college. After completion of a 3 year medical school program, another 3-7 years of residency in the specialty areas of obstetrics and gynecology is required. Yearly continuing-education is required to maintain licensing and certification. An OB/GYN must maintain medical malpractice insurance, which is not inexpensive."

Neurologists treat established neurological patients by prescribing drugs or treatments and other therapies such as diet and lifestyle changes.  Typically, they receive referrals from non-specialist physicians or emergency room personnel to make a diagnoses and provide patient treatment for neurological issues. Often, neurologists sub-specialize into a specific area of expertise.  In these cases, they will be primarily responsible only for issues related to that particular area of expertise (such as multiple sclerosis) and refer and communicate other issues back to the patient\u2019s primary care physician for treatment.",
            "Neurologists work in a few different environments.  They may work in private practice in a medical office setting, providing specialized care to a certain subset of neurological patients. They may work in a hospital setting and serve a more general patient base, including referrals from other hospital departments related to neurological issues.  Some travel may be required to work with patients in various situations, including their home or other hospitals.",
            "Extensive education including a doctor of medicine degree (MD) with board certification in neurology is required.  Licensing by state and federal agencies is also required.  In some positions, certification in Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) is needed, as neurological patients may be in danger of severe and quick changes in health status."

            "Plastic surgeons help create quality-of-life improvements for patients, generally working within a specialty that focuses on changing the appearance of various body parts or facial features. They work frequently to assist in the long-term care of burn patients and other victims of disfiguring injuries. Some plastic surgeons focus primarily on elective procedures such as facelifts, rhinoplasty, and breast augmentation and reduction. They may also work with other specialists to assist in corrective procedures for birth defects or natal injuries. Additionally, plastic surgeons are common consultants for oncologists, as some cancer surgeries may alter the patient's appearance; the plastic surgeon may be able to mitigate these effects.",
            "Plastic surgeons work in a variety of institutions. Some plastic surgeons are on staff of hospitals, serve as on-call physicians, or work as consultant specialists; the need to work on-call shifts occasionally requires work at odd times of day and night at hospitals. Specialists typically work in a private clinical setting; in these cases, the plastic surgeon generally works regular business hours in a smaller clinical environment, offering preoperative consultations, surgical services, and postoperative therapy as needed.",
            "To work as a plastic surgeon or doctor within that specialty, an individual must first complete an undergraduate and then an accredited medical school program, along with residency and internship requirements. Plastic surgeons must usually be board certified, which requires additional training beyond the standard general practitioner education."

            "Dietitians must stay up to date on the latest scientific research on nutrition. There are different types of dietitians: clinical dietitians, management dietitians or community dietitians. A clinical dietitian provides medical nutrition to patients; they work in hospitals, nursing homes or long-term care facilities. For example a clinical dietitian might work with a patient with chronic kidney disease on an appropriate diet. Management dietitians work within the food service industry in settings such as cafeterias, corporations or hospitals. The type of work performed includes developing meal plans, being in charge of kitchen staff or other dietitians, and running the overall kitchen operation; sometimes, management dietitian buy food and handle daily management activities. Community dietitians work in the public arena providing educational nutrition programs to groups and individuals. They work in public health clinics, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and with health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A community dietitian could work with a specific group; for example, they can provide education to pregnant women.",

Some states require the dietitian to be licensed as a registered dietitian or a similar credential. After completion of the necessary degrees and licensing, the dietitian completes hundreds of hours of supervised training in internship programs.",

            "Medical research assistants generally work underneath principal researchers or investigators. They often work on teams of researchers and assistants who are learning more about a topic or intending to prove a hypothesis, and may be responsible for gathering data from various sources. Data entry of gathered information is usually performed by the assistant, so it is important to have strong computer, typing, and ten-key skills and experience with database and spreadsheet software. Record-keeping and filing skills are also important, as the research assistant must keep comprehensive files and reports.",
            "It is important that medical research assistants keep their files in a meticulous manner, and some may even quality-check the data of other staff members. In some cases, they will assist with simple data analysis; when research involves human patients, they may be in charge of outreach to patients and scheduling them for evaluations. They may also be expected to gather any materials needed for the research, which often includes keeping inventory and ordering supplies when they are low.",
            "Some medical research assistant positions are open to college students, while others require a bachelor\u2019s degree and relevant work experience. Much of the work is done independently, so it is important to be self-driven and a good problem-solver. There may occasionally be be time-constraints which must be met, and strong communication skills, both oral and written, are important in order to work well with with other researchers and outside parties."
