            "A marketing manager is a person within a company who supervises and helps create the various advertising or merchandising sales campaigns the business uses to sell itself and its products. A marketing manager can be assigned to a single product, a product line, a brand, or the entire company. The manager typically must incorporate a variety of input from creative, research, advertising, and sales teams.",
            "A marketing manager typically oversees one or more marketing campaigns. The manager may devise the entirety of the campaign. However, he or she will typically see a generalized opportunity and then enlist various members of his or her marketing team to brainstorm campaign ideas. Normally, a marketing campaign will also require market research to determine the various product appeal to various demographic groups.",
            "One of the key skills a marketing manager must possess is organization. Even small changes or iterations on existing marketing campaigns can require a great deal of coordination and timing precision. Marketing managers typically must orchestrate that across multiple groups and teams within the company. Most marketing managers will be required to have a marketing degree from a university, with management disciplines and postgraduate work favored. Marketing managers typically work regular hours during the work week, but they should expect to put in longer days when launching new campaigns."

            "Vice presidents (VP) of marketing are highly-placed executives or board-level directors within a company who are responsible for determining strategies to improve or maintain the market-shares for the goods or services sold. This involves setting strategies in many areas concerned with the presentation of company assets and products, from branding to advertising and even pricing and discount structures. The marketing VP will typically have a department dedicated to researching and providing useful analytical data on the effectiveness of current marketing, as well as ideas for future product development.",
            "As a director-level executive, the VP of marketing typically sits on an executive board within the company, usually as a direct report to a division president, chief executive, or chief operating officer. These VPs directly supervise managers and directors who oversee teams involved in branding, advertising/media, and research, and often meet with these managers to receive reports and help direct the company's marketing vision. They also help these managers to set departmental and team budgets, as well as pull data related to expenses and marketing effectiveness and present it in detailed reports to other board members and company chiefs.",
            "As marketing VPs, they can also be a factor in driving future product/service offerings. By carefully using market research tools, they can help determine the shifting needs and wants of the company's current consumer base and determine how to best meet that demand. This research can result in emphasizing existing products more, or working with research and development team leaders to bring new products to the market.",
            "A typical marketing VP has extensive practical experience at all levels of marketing and branding, and candidates for the position should also have extensive education in marketing and business administration/management. Like most company vice presidents, a marketing VP should expect to work long hours in an office environment and will usually have an administrative staff to manage. Travel may also be part of the job."

The brand manager's job is to simply control and manage all the ways that particular brand is exposed to the public. The manager works to assure that consumers associate positive responses with the brand, which also help drive advertising and marketing initiatives.",
            "Normally, a brand manager will work with an entire staff as part of a marketing department. He or she will enlist marketing research to determine consumer attitudes regarding the brand name. The manager will assess the intended market for the brand or product. Then he or she will attempt to use various branding strategies to better place goods or services within the brand in its respective marketplace. The brand manager can do this before launching a new trademark, or he or she can use brand strategy to strengthen an existing brand's position.",
            "Most brand managers will have university degrees in marketing or advertising from an accredited university. Brand managers typically will also need to acquire extensive, practical experience within marketing departments before being entrusted with supervising the image of individual brands for a company. Most brand managers work regular business hours during the week in an office environment."

            "Business development directors can have a varied range of tasks pertaining to a company's overall business development. The responsibilities held are often higher up the corporate ladder than those of sales or operations managers, and therefore more intensive. Business development directors often answer directly to the owner of a company, board of directors, and/or to shareholders. Many of the tasks involved are mental in nature. Some include developing the necessary strategies for successful operations throughout the business. These can include fine tuning departmental tasks, aligning the IT department, figuring out how to market a company's goods or services to a wider market, negotiating with suppliers, understanding any legal matters that may arise in the course of business, managing sales, understanding the financial needs of the business, and coordinating all of these areas into cohesive action plans for the business as a whole. The job is usually done during the day and in an office environment. Some responsibilities can go into off hours and may be completed from home, but a majority will take place Monday through Friday. Typical work weeks for this position are at the forty hour mark and above. Many business development directors hold degrees in business administration. Many who have a business management degree in this kind of position it have concentrated their degrees in areas like accounting, macroeconomics, management theory, business law and/or information systems. A degree may not always be required, but it can be very helpful. Employers often chose applicants with master's degrees in business over applicants with bachelor's degrees."

            "A brand strategist helps a company identify who their target market is and then seeks to determine the best way to positively interact with that target market so that consumers within that demographic respond favorably to the products offered by the company. Along the way, a good brand strategist will also seek out opportunities to expand the brand's profile and impact by enlarging the target demographic and potential market for the company's offerings.",
            "What a brand strategist will typically do for a company is try to help the decision makers within that organization see the company through the eyes of their target consumer groups. The brand manager will work to determine what key factors in purchase decisions cause people to engage with some companies while eschewing others. Normally the brand strategist will pore through market research reports based on demographics and consumer behavior habits and attempt to find areas of opportunity for the company to act to strengthen its brand awareness. Sometimes the brand strategist will also seek to identify potential new consumer demographics and develop reports and ideas for expanding brand awareness outside the areas identified by the company and marketers. In these cases, the brand strategist will again consider market research, as well as the cost of acquiring new customers when he or she reports on this viability to board members. A key part of the brand strategist's job is also ensuring that marketing and advertising efforts stay \u201con brand\u201d. In other words, they reflect the overall strategy that has been developed to enhance positive consumer awareness. The strategist will typically work closely with marketing, advertising, and creative departments to ensure that efforts remain focused within the confines of the brand's growth strategy.",
            "To work as a brand strategist, a person must typically have a college degree in marketing or a similar business discipline regarding consumer behavior. Many brand strategists work as outside consultants for companies, but larger corporations with multiple products or services may have their own brand strategists on payroll to help guide marketing approaches. Typically a brand strategist works in an office during regular hours of the business week."

Account directors manage all existing accounts, taking payments and entering them into their system correctly. They send out bills, process payments, and make sure that their clients' accounts are in order. They also must attract new customers by visiting them in person or talking with them on the telephone. Handling paperwork and analyzing reports about competitors is also important, as are filing monthly inventory reports and ensuring that anything needed for the account is readily available.",

They also must be able to handle any complaints or problems in a timely and respectable manner. Most employers require directors to have a bachelor's degree in advertising, public relations, or another business-related field. Professional certification is also available. It is important for account directors to have good organizational skills and writing ability."

Some daily tasks include managing budgets, coordinating operations with external vendors, managing and executing website updates, working on annual financial plans, and working closely with other departments to promote the company\u2019s goals. Positions as an associate brand manager are most often found in the marketing industry, although some larger companies in other industries hire these managers to work in-house.",
            "Associate brand managers generally work as part of a branding and/or marketing team, with the size of the team depending on the company's size and number of client projects. Direct supervision and feedback is provided by the brand manager. There are minimal physical requirements for the job beyond moving around the office and typing on a computer. This job typically takes place in an office setting, and these associate managers generally work during standard business operating hours, but flexibility for overtime or occasional travel may be necessary.",
            "The typical minimum educational requirement for associate brand manager positions is a bachelor\u2019s degree in a related field, though many companies prefer an master's degree. Specific experience requirements vary from company to company, but three to five years of experience in a related position is common. Also needed are analytical thinking, organizational, and communication skills. Knowledge of basic computer programs such as the Microsoft Office suite and database analysis programs are preferred as well."

They help publicize and coordinate message delivery through a variety of platforms to highlight new offerings, updates, changes, or other important information an organization wishes to reach the highest number of interested parties.",
            "A media planner must first be familiar with the goods or services associated with their company. The planner then assesses the needs of marketing campaigns and/or advertising rollouts. They offer suggestions on which platforms might perform optimally for these programs. The media planner ensures a consistency of the campaign message and then works with creative departments or independent contractors to acquire necessary media assets to support the campaign\u2019s goals. These assets are then coordinated to the web, focused emails, television, radio, magazines, and newspapers as required.",
            "Media planners also play an important role in crisis management within a company. In a crisis, the planner coordinates all media inquiries and either act as spokesperson or assign that role. The planner works with management within the organization to determine the proper messaging on the crisis and then ensure that all information released is consistent, on message, and coordinated through outlets in a proactive manner. Due to the need for this position to purchase and contract for assets outside the company, a media planner is typically required to establish a budget for approval and expected to adhere to it. Media purchases by the planner are expected to conform to the organization\u2019s branding and image and may require approval by marketing management.",
            "The planner must be organized, have excellent communications skills, and be proficient with computers. Persons wanting to work as a media planner likely need a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications or a related field. Additionally, many companies  look for prior experience in marketing, media assets management, or a related field."
