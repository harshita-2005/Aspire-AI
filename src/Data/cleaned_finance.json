            "Accountants perform financial calculations for companies in a wide variety of fields. Some common duties include creating sales and cash flow reports, administering payroll, keeping balance sheets, carrying out billing activities, managing budgets and keeping inventory. The accountant may also be responsible for filing taxes for the company, as well as reviewing past reports to generate income forecasts.",
            "Occasionally, internal audits must be carried out to make sure that the various areas of the company are performing as expected; the accountant must also make sure that staff members are adhering to company policies and relevant laws. The accountant should be able to create accurate, detailed reports to illustrate data; sometimes, these reports have to be presented to management. The accountant may oversee the financial transactions of one department or multiple departments within their organization.",
            "A bachelor's degree in accounting is required for this position, as is status as a certified public accountant (CPA). Previous accounting experience is generally required or preferred as well. Knowledge of accounting software such as Quickbooks and Microsoft Excel is needed. Additionally, many of the accountant's tasks are performed independently so it is essential to be self-motivated; however, collaboration is necessary, and the accountant must be able to work as part of a team."

They review these reports and tabulate the company's finances so the company knows exactly how much money they are spending and in which departments.  They also tabulate how much the company is making and relate it to the cost of running each department.  With the results that chartered accountants find, management may make decisions on how to change their spending to improve production and revenue.  A chartered accountant may also handle the taxes for the company they work for.  Depending on the size of the business that employs them, chartered accountants may work with a team of accountants or on their own.  They may report to a senior chartered accountant or a director of accounting or finances.  Their work hours are normal business hours on Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.  The tools they work with are financial and statistical software, reports, computers, telephones, pens and paper, calculators, and other typical office supplies.",

            "The responsibility of the quality assurance auditor is to periodically test and assess quality control systems to ensure that a company's practices conform to both internal and external standards. A quality assurance manager may work within a company as part of its internal quality control team. Quality assurance auditors may also work as independent contractors for third-party auditing firms. The individual duties are much the same in either instance, though internal quality assurance auditors may also take on other tasks relevant to the quality control process, such as inspecting or sorting.",
            "A quality assurance auditor must have a thorough understanding of a company's audit processes and industry quality standards. QA auditors must have knowledge of quality control procedures and the ability to assess whether or not a firm is in compliance. They are able to effectively manage working time and possess a thoroughly developed analytical skill set. They must also be able to coordinate auditing teams and ensure proper communication between teams and clients or internal management. External auditors may be required to travel extensively to meet and work with clients. Internal auditors may also travel if their firms have widespread facilities.",
            "The educational and training requirements may differ for quality assurance auditors, mostly depending on whether they are internal or external. An internal auditor may only be required to hold a high school diploma, with the employer  offering the necessary training for successful applicants. External auditors are often required to understand a wide variety of quality control systems and standards, so more on-the-job experience is usually necessary, with up to three years of decision-making position experience."

            "Credit analysts specialize in determining a business's or individual's credit worthiness. A credit analyst looks at all past credit purchases and, based on their findings, decides if a person or a corporation is worthy to receive a loan. The majority of credit analysts have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, business, economics, or accounting. It is suggested that people with this job enjoy working with numbers, because they will be reviewing numerical figures as a part of their daily function. He or she will usually work indoors in an office environment. Credit analysts must have excellent communication skills, be great listeners, and be able to perform multiple tasks. Analysts can be employed by major banks, credit unions, investment management groups, and the U.S. Department of State, to name a few. They usually work Monday through Friday, but this can change. If an analyst is working on a major case decision for a corporation, for example, work outside of normal hours may be required. Credit analysts not only make decisions on credit worthiness; they also recommend steps to improve credit ratings. Customers can range from corporations to individuals trying to secure a loan. This is a professional, white-collar job. There is a high demand and growth opportunities for credit analysts because the economy is constantly changing."

            "Much of the work of credit analysts requires the use of computers and specialized software. They should have a certain degree of experience with financial software, particularly those that are used in credit analysis. Analysts may also be required to present statistical exhibits and build computer models of financial projections, both of which require more extensive computer skills.",
            "In-depth knowledge of the industry in which an analyst works is essential. For those working in the real estate industry, for example, being aware of past and current market trends enable them to make informed decisions about the feasibility of a certain piece of property. Thorough knowledge of financial developments also helps credit analysts present proposals that would benefit the company.",

Corporations, non-profit agencies, and government agencies often employ associate auditors, as do outside accounting firms hired to review companies' financial statements.",
            "Associate auditors generally perform their duties under the direction of a senior auditor, and they are expected to apply generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) to make certain that management's expectations and government requirements are met. They also make recommendations for potential or required areas of improvements. Additionally, associate auditors may review company policies regarding safety expectations and legal requirements as specified by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).",
            "In virtually all cases, associate auditors work indoors in an office. If employed by an outside accounting firm, they often work in an office within that firm, and they may also work on-site in an office provided by the company whose materials they are auditing. Generally, associate auditors work a daytime shift, although this may vary depending on the time of year and deadlines for filing regular reports.",
            "The educational requirement for the associate auditor position varies, although most have earned at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting or a related field. Many associate auditors also have advanced degrees in accounting, audits, or tax-related specialties, particularly if their position has significant responsibilities. Often associate auditors have gained their certified public accountant \u2013 or CPA \u2013 license as well, which is also useful to advance higher in the field as they gain employment experience; it is often mandatory for supervisory positions."

Often, they must report their findings to the organization's governing body and recommend any needed changes. This job is particularly essential in heavily regulated industries such as health care and financial services.",

Depending on the requirements of the specific field with which the compliance officer works, prior experience may be necessary.  Most positions require some sort of a certification, such as a Certified Medical Compliance Officer credential for  the healthcare field,or a Certified Compliance and Regulatory Professional credential for overseas banks operating in the United States.

            "Financial accountability is pivotal to maintaining a healthy business, and financial accountants conduct a number of functions to ensure this is possible. They manage payroll, taxes, income, spending, and educating their employer on financial information. Work days for financial accountants can be a bit longer than a standard 9-to-5 job, because of strict deadlines on all projects that financial accountants are given. Generally, financial accountants do not need to work directly with employees; if they discover discrepancies with posted reports, they inform management.",
            "Financial accountants need a strong background in math and must be ready to examine financial figures on a daily basis. An associate's or bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting is needed for this job, as is knowledge of statistics, arithmetic, and algebra. The ability to use computers and accounting software programs is important, and financial accountants must be able to use computers to perform mathematical computations and create presentations. Different employers will use different accounting software, so it is good for financial accountants to be able to adapt quickly to new programs."

At minimum, a tax manager must be able to prepare and file the taxes for the company in a complete and accurate manner to minimize the risk of an audit.  They also are expected to find as many deductions as possible to ensure that the organization is not overpaying taxes.  Other responsibilities of the tax manager relate to internal public offerings (IPOs), mergers, and other acquisitions; tax managers ensure these events are properly documented from a tax perspective.  This can include researching and reviewing current tax laws and technical tax memorandum to ensure accuracy and completeness.",

Additionally, proficiency in QuickBooks and the Microsoft Office suite is required; employers might also ask candidates to be proficient in other accounting software as well.

            "When companies, organizations, or government entities need to raise capital, one of the best ways to do so is to turn to the services of an investment banker. Investment bankers are the highly skilled professionals at financial institutions who examine an entity's financial health, capital needs, and goals. Then they recommend a strategy to improve or manifest them. The investment banker then acts as a go-between for the organization looking to raise money and those looking to make financial investments.",
            "In the first part of his or her general responsibilities, an investment banker will examine the goals and needs of an organization seeking to raise capital through investment, typically through a retainer. The investment banker will usually be granted access to all financial information the company has, even that of a proprietary or sensitive nature. The investment banker then helps formulate a strategy that may involve selling bonds, issuing and selling stocks, taking on loan debt, or a combination of any and all of those. Once the organization has signed off on a strategy to raise money through investments, the banker then is entrusted to find and work with prospective investors who match the risk/reward profile of the entity attempting to raise capital. In this area of work, the investment banker may act largely as a salesperson, helping to create interest and offering encouragement to invest.",
            "An investment banker must possess a variety of skills. He or she must be detail-oriented and able to analyze financial data down to the smallest minutae. He or she must also possess strong statistical analysis skills to help forecast the best method to secure investment for a company, as well as forecast risk and reward to potential investors. Finally, the banker must possess excellent interpersonal skills, as much of the work here does involve a modicum of salesmanship. Most investment bankers will have a four-year degree in business or finance, but MBAs are typically preferred in this field. These bankers typically work 50 hours per week or more in an office environment."

            "Depending on the field and employer, a risk management analyst may have a variety of responsibilities. Generally speaking, this employee is a person who studies the ways large companies avoid financial risks and potential pitfalls, and makes suggestions to improve these systems and maintain their efficiency.",
            "Almost all large corporations have risk-management teams. A risk management analyst at a non-financial company will focus mainly on assessing how well the company's insurance works and how related costs can be contained. Typically, this involves examining liability insurance as it relates to customers and auditing the ways that customer claims are collected and filed. The analyst examines these processes and looks for trends in how claims may be paid by the liability insurers for the company, and works to determine if procedures can be adjusted to reduce settlements and payouts that affect premiums paid. Additionally, the analyst constantly examines the marketplace for the most cost-effective insurance solutions possible for his/her employer.",
            "Risk management analysts also perform similar duties related to employee claims regarding injury, wrongful terminations, and other areas that may lead to insurance claims or litigation. This analyst is less interested in specific case strategies and more interested in overall procedures, reporting methods, and claims processes. He/she also makes recommendations to help ensure the best practices which reduce overall costs for the employer.",
            "In financial institutions, risk management analysts may have an entirely different set of responsibilities. Banks and investment groups typically use these analysts to assess investment strategies and financial products to determine worst-case scenarios and financial exposure for the company. These analysts will generate reports to balance against expected return on investment reports from financial product and investment teams. They also make recommendations regarding the expected risks and dangers that specific strategies or products may bring to the institution.",
            "Most risk management analysts have at least a four-year degree from a college or university. Most also specialize in business and finance, while some may find it useful to continue into studying business or insurance and liability law. Generally, these analysts work regular business hours in an office environment."

            "Risk management managers are in charge of managing a group of analysts to identify and eliminate business risks for their organization. They are responsible for conducting risk assessments and creating business reports for future decision-making tasks. Risk management managers use their expertise and analytical abilities to transform risk analysis into tangible results and/or business recommendations; they convey this complex information to managers in their organization, interpreting data in a reliable and understandable manner. These managers identify possible financial opportunities to solve business obstacles and improve efficiency, as well as assist with the implementation of business strategies and help with planning using previous feedback. They must create strong business relationships with internal departments and ensure process integrity by setting up strict business requirements and eliminating risk as needed.",
            "Additionally, risk management managers execute risk management projects using trending and forecasting data based on prior research and results. They oversee design control experiments as required and conduct database queries, as well as assume a lead role in drafting responses for risk management interactions. The manager may also oversee junior personnel, providing guidance, instruction, and feedback. In all tasks, the risk management manager must follow strict privacy regulations to prevent legal action. They generally report their progress to the risk management director in their organization.",

Previous experience - especially in a managerial capacity - is required for this job as well. In addition, industry certifications may be preferred. Risk management managers must possess strong communication skills and strong leadership skills to lead a group of risk management professionals and mentor junior staff as needed."

Regardless of reporting structure, senior tax managers have final responsibility over a number of tasks carried out by the wider tax office. These tasks include internal audits, ensuring compliance with tax laws, researching new tax laws and related events, searching for internal issues that might spur tax issues, reporting all findings to executives, forecasting taxes for accounting purposes, coordinating foreign tax filings, and calculating and making income tax payments.",

They must be very knowledgeable when it comes to various financial services that are offered by the bank. Not only is this great for selling products, but it also helps when it comes time to determine a customer\u2019s financial viability. Knowing all the details of how the bank\u2019s mortgages, checking and savings accounts, and security portfolios work is essential in providing the best service possible for their customers.Additionally, risk management managers execute risk management projects using trending and forecasting data based on prior research and results. They oversee design control experiments as required and conduct database queries, as well as assume a lead role in drafting responses for risk management interactions. The manager may also oversee junior personnel, providing guidance, instruction, and feedback. In all tasks, the risk management manager must follow strict privacy regulations to prevent legal action. They generally report their progress to the risk management director in their organization.",

For most entry-level positions, a formal education might not be required, but having a bachelor's degree in business, finance, or a related field is highly preferred. Previous sales experience, such as in retail or real estate, is also highly favored. Some banks also required potential recruits to be licensed by FINRA, which involves passing the Series 6 and Series 63 exams. In order to qualify for these tests, recruits are required to be sponsored by a financial institution. Agents must reregister every two years and complete continuing education in order to stay licensed. A licensed agent is then able to order securities for customers and sell mutual funds."

            "A wide variety of companies have audit supervisors, ranging from information technology (IT) companies to the food service industry. The level of experience and education required for these positions often depend on the industry, as specialized applications may require experience in specific fields. For example, working as an audit supervisor for an IT company often requires a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. However, non-specialized positions may require only a high school diploma or equivalent, although some companies prefer bachelor\u2019s degrees in accounting, finance, or a related disciplines. Work experience requirements for positions often start with two or more years of experience in a management or audit role, though entry-level openings can be found as well.",
            "As an audit supervisor, much of the daily work involves training and guiding other auditors. This includes both basic training and careful monitoring of auditors to ensure all protocols and policies are being carefully followed; this may include company policies and/or government regulations. Other daily tasks include handling disputes, performing scheduling, reporting on progress, and managing time budgets. All of this requires large amounts of direct interaction with the whole audit team, as well as reports to upper-level management.",
            "Most work as an audit supervisor is done in an indoor environment with few physical requirements beyond basic tasks such as moving around the office. The job requires strong analytic skills, great communication skills, and the ability to evaluate risks in a timely manner. Work hours may vary from company to company, but standard business operating hours are common for this position."

A financial analyst carefully studies marketplace trends, demographics and microeconomic factors to help the company make smart investments. The financial analyst may also provide advice to companies on issuing their own bonds, splitting stock and other areas of concern.",
            "One of the most important roles for a financial analyst is to fully understand how and where a company has invested its resources, as well as how secure and viable that financial outlay will be going forward. An analyst needs to not only understand how current investments affect the company, but also how those investments and future financial interactions will impact short- and long-term growth. The analyst is expected to provide information on the company's current financial position and make recommendations to company decision-makers. For instance, the analyst may inform an executive board about whether expansion may be high risk or help the company decide on issuing bonds to cover capital improvements. The analyst may also provide advice and analysis on protecting a company's wealth in the short term during economic downturns.",

They must be talented in mathematics and organized so as not to miss any financial information.  Even missing one number in the thousands of numbers they see every year can completely change the standing and decisions of their company executives.  So, it is imperative that they be accurate.  Senior accountants also will often manage teams of accountants when working for larger companies.",

Work supplies for the job are a calculator, computer, telephone, pen and paper, charts, graphs, ledgers and other common office supplies.  As senior accountants are the head of their department, they tend to report to an executive such as the vice president or general manager of their business.  Senior accountants generally work regular business hours."

            "A credit manager primarily focuses on collecting money owed to their company, whether it be for some type of service or a particular product.  When someone fails to pay the money that is owed, these professionals  initiate legal action and potentially take part in the collection process. Further, a credit manager also plays a major role in negotiating payment options, which could include re-structuring payment plans to make them more manageable based on a party's financial capabilities. The credit manager is also responsible for tracking certain accounts and keeping a close eye on those that have gone unpaid for an extended period of time.  A credit manager may have different duties depending on the size of the company in which they are employed.",
            "A credit manager must also be able to communicate in a precise way, as a good majority of the job involves dealing with the company leaders, independent clients, and the public.  In addition, a person working in this career must keep thorough, organized financial records that can be used at legal proceedings and other stages of the collection process."

            "Being a senior associate of investment banking requires leadership ability, experience, knowledge, and foresight.  The primary duties of this position are to advise and handle other people's money, so there is a high degree of accountability as the wrong decisions not only affect the senior associate, but also his/her bank and its clients.  Some customers have enough riding on their investments to make or break them.",
            "A senior associate in investment banking presides over a team of associates who handle client portfolios and advise clients on their investments.  Handling the actual investments is also a responsibility; they must be well-aware of all forms of investment risks so they can properly inform clients on potential gains and losses, as well as the likelihood of either.  The senior associate tends to handle the highest-profile clients, which are those with the most to gain or lose.  These are often business accounts rather than individuals.",
            "The working environment for this position is usually an office within a bank.  They have their own office and work with typical materials such as telephones and computers.",
            "The educational requirements include a Master's degree in Business Administration or a related field.  Those in this position must also have particular certifications or licenses depending the state in which they reside. Several years of banking and investing are essential and at least two years of advising and/or supervising experience is highly recommended.",
            "While nobody is perfect at predicting how markets will unfold, senior associates in investment banking must be far better at this skill than the average individual or even lower-level investment professionals in the same field.  People rely on them to handle their money and build on it in the best possible manner. More importantly, they are relied on to protect their clients' money so they never have to experience a major loss, and provide good leadership over a team of investment associates in achieving the same goals."

            "Junior accountants provide a vital service to various companies by accurately recording corporate finances. Typical daily job duties include reconciling company bank accounts, balancing financial records and preparing monthly reports. They generally work with a team of other accountants and report to a senior accountant. The level of confidentiality and discretion required of junior accountants is great because they work with private company information and are given access to secure accounts.",
            "Junior accountants are generally expected to give oral or written reports daily, weekly and/or monthly about company debts, budgets, deficits and other expenditures. They also correct financial errors and create reports of those errors. When there are subsidiary or sister companies, junior accountants may also be responsible for maintaining and balancing the financial books of those companies. Junior accountants also are involved in the filing of a company's taxes, maintaining corporate tax records, providing analyses of the financial state of their employing company, and handling quarterly and yearly bookkeeping reports.",
            "To become a junior accountant, a bachelor's degree in accounting or related field is usually required. Some knowledge of computer-based accounting programs like QuickBooks and/or PeachTree are usually appreciated but not always necessary. A background in tax assessment or banking is helpful, but not necessary. Junior accountants must have strong oral and written communication skills, keen eye for detail, intermediate computer proficiency, and mathematical aptitude. They should also be detail oriented, self driven, deadline sensitive and quality-focused."

Financial officers also may supervise spending, which can include investments and cash management; they may be responsible for preparing financial statements while maintaining compliance with state and federal government regulations. Managing an internal audit and reporting findings, as well as making recommendations based on that audit, is often part of the duties of a finance officer.",
            "Finance officers typically work as a team, typically under tight deadlines; they also often work closely with the CEO and other officers within the company. Their typical hours are a business' regular hours, although some overtime might be required for special projects or under tight deadlines.",
            "Companies typically select candidates that are trustworthy, honest, efficient, and ethical. This position requires strong accounting, analytical, problem solving, and computer skills as well. In terms of education, companies typically look for candidates with, at minimum, a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance, accounting, or business administration; some may also seek post-graduate or master's level experience in an accounting program and some related financial experience. Professional certification is available for finance officers. One such certification is the certified public finance officer (CPFO); continuing education is required to maintain certifications, and many employers will provide or subsidize those opportunities."

They also open a variety of accounts for clients, as well as participate in seminars that will increase their customer service skills. Additional tasks that bank officers perform include paying and receiving money transfers on behalf of clients, ensuring compliance of operational regulations, and following strict privacy rules. Bank officers also receive loan applications and submit them for further review, as well as generate new business through direct mailings, business calls, and telemarketing. Additionally, they complete necessary documentation that other financial institutions require for foreign transfers. One of their main tools include a personal computer that access client information, financial balances, and make adjustments to customer accounts.",

Bank officers must work well in a team environment to achieve all the institutional goals. They should also have strong communication skills and interact in a professional manner with all customers.

They manage staff members in addressing customer claims and enrolling new customers by setting target metrics, giving performance evaluations, and providing staff members with training opportunities and guidance. Further, the branch manager also deals with any escalated customer service issues that may arise. The branch manager also performs several human resource functions such as screening applicants and hiring new team members.",
            "On top of operational and human resource functions, the branch manager also performs several finance-related tasks such as managing budgets and (possibly) procuring funds for special projects. Additionally, the branch manager must always look for opportunities to increase sales by expanding their reach and networking with potential clients. The manager often reports directly to a regional manager, filing periodic reports that include sales figures, staff evaluations, market research, and budget analyses.",
            "Insurance office branch managers usually hold a bachelor's degree and have several years of supervisory experience. Attention to detail and strong interpersonal skills are essential to succeed in this position. Due to fluctuations in customer demand, branch managers may need to work long hours and keep flexible schedules."

            "Fund accountants are responsible for keeping detailed financial records for nonprofits and government agencies.  First and foremost, they must maintain the integrity of this type of data first and foremost. They must account for how the company is using its funds, which may include producing separate reports to be produced for individual funds. The accountant maintains a chart of accounts to accurately report the expenditures from each ledger.  Proper documentation is mandatory for the accountants to determine if the funds are being used in the best possible manner.  They also assist these companies in deciding the best way to use available revenue and stay within an appropriate expense budget.  They generally serve as the middle man between the investor and the business.",
            "Most employers require fund accountants to have a bachelor's or master's degree in accounting, business administration, or a similar field.  Additionally, many employers request that their candidates be certified public accountants (CPA);  this is necessary for accountants working with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It's imperative that any fund accountants have proficient knowledge of basic computer programs, including relevant accounting software.  Fund accountants usually work in an office, but they may be required to travel to different offices within their company.  Further, the candidate may need to be able to lift approximately 15 to 20 pounds, as boxes or files of records may be heavy."

            "An investment banking analyst is an entry-level position at most investment banks and financial firms.  The position is a stepping stone for further advancement and responsibility in banking.  Investment analysts work with more senior members of the company on various investment banking transactions.  The most common duties for investment analysts are producing deal-related materials, performing industry research, performing financial analyses, and collecting materials for due diligence.",
            "Investment analysts help compile and prepare financial packages used in deals.  They have to be comfortable interacting with high powered clients like CEOs and CFOs.  Financial analysts may have to analyze tax returns and financial reports and then prepare written reports about them for review by more senior staff.  Investment analysts must be able to understand and work with complex financial modelling.  Often, they are left to their own devices on projects, so adaptability and quick thinking are real assets.",
            "Generally, a B.A. in Accounting, Finance, Economic or Business is required for the position.  At most firms, this is a pre-MBA position, but occasionally an MBA is required for an investment analyst position.  One to three years of work experience in financial services is preferred.  The ability to multitask and maintain a positive outlook in the face of adversity are key skills.  Excellent research and writing skills are needed for this position.  You must have good computer skills and a mastery of programs like Microsoft Office.  Also, financial analysts must be able to excel as members of a team and be able to add value to their teams."

Many auditing manager positions include some work with internal company affairs; they may ensure that employees are all acting ethically in their profession and not engaging in behavior that may hurt the company or put their interests ahead of the company. This includes keeping a record of all company finances to ensure that no funds are \u201clost\u201d because of a lack of organization or individual greed.",

To hold a management position in auditing, an individual should have three to five years of experience to develop an in-depth understanding of auditing practice. Finally, an acute attention to detail and a meticulous nature are preferred qualities of an auditing manager."

            "Senior credit analysts are responsible for assessing credit requests and producing a recommendation based on a variety of factors; this involves a careful analysis of a client\u2019s financial information, including income statements, tax forms, cash flow history, and current debt. Using this information and best practices and methods, senior credit analysts assign credit requests a rating based on their assessment of the probability of default by the client.  Using this information along with the proposed loan amount and terms, the risk to the lender can be determined and a final recommendation given.",
            "Senior credit analysts work closely with loan officers (who are the primary contact point to the client) to inform them about loan policy and the results of the risk assessment.  In some cases, credit analysts may work with clients as well to verify information and perform additional research on their financial history and future.  Some senior credit analysts may also be responsible for working with clients after a loan has been approved to evaluate past due accounts and manage collections. Senior credit analysts generally work in an office environment during regular business hours.",
            "Senior credit analysts are required to hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance, accounting, or a related field.  Several years\u2019 experience working with credit or loan evaluation is also required, as senior credit analysts work relatively independently on their credit assessments. However, they may be required to have client contact or work with other credit analysts on more complicated accounts."

Senior financial analysts may be required to manage teams of analysts, which includes assigning tasks, reviewing reports, determining risks and rewards, compiling data, and organizing presentations for upper management. Senior financial analysts may also be responsible for training team members to develop additional skills and/or improve their existing skills.",

This position could include traveling between offices or even traveling globally. A standard work week of 40 hours is common. However, as the complexities of the work may vary from company to company, the hours that a senior financial analyst is required to work will also vary according to business needs, critical deadlines, and the needs of management.",

Degrees in finance, accounting, business administration, economics, or entrepreneurship are helpful to the candidate. However, due to the competitive nature of this position, previous experience in financial analysis, management-level accounting, and management-level cost analysis can be very beneficial to candidates."

            "A business analyst is someone who scrutinizes the financial aspects of the business and determines if there are any changes that could be made to make the business more successful. A successful analyst needs a detailed mind that is able to analyze data and come to conclusions based on this data. Based on these conclusions the analyst makes recommendations and changes to improve the business.",
            "A business analyst requires essentially two overarching goals. One is to be able to gather, analyze and interpret data in areas such as budgets, financial planning and forecasting, and cash flow projections. Secondly, the business analyst must be able to coordinate, organize and direct organizations of projects and processes related to the financial sector of business. They must develop and implement goals and procedures based off of the data that they analyze.",
            "A business analyst will often require a bachelor's degree in accounting, finance or information technologies. They may also have a technical background as a programmer or computer engineer. A successful business analyst must have this background as they draw upon this as the means to be able to interpret the data. However, they must also be able to work with people within the business to design feasible and obtainable goals to improve the business. Thus, they must not only be able to identify the problem but also come up with the solution to fix it.",

They must also be able to interpret corporate or merchants' financial statements and/or personal credit reports and maintain good relationships with processors and other staff within the company.",

A bachelor's degree in a relevant field is often required for this position, and some employers also require relevant work experience. Strong communication skills are important for risk analysts, and they should also be detail-oriented and able to work well under pressure. Flexibility may also be necessary in order to meet deadlines. Some may be required to attend additional training, workshops, or conferences or read relevant professional journals, while others may need to travel to meet clients."

These directors generally lead a finance team in creating strategic plans regarding the company's finances; this includes both accounting duties and financial analyses and projections. The team which the finance director leads should identify risks and areas in need of improvement so the company can identify mistakes before they come to realization and further increase profits.",
            "Aspiring finance directors should have a master\u2019s degree in business administration, economics, finance, or a related field, though some employers will accept applicants who have a bachelor\u2019s degree; years of experience in the financial field are also typically required for the position.",
            "Strong teamwork skills are important in this position in order to work seamlessly with co-workers, and both written and verbal communication skills are also important. Finance directors also create financial reports on a periodic basis; these reports may need to be presented to upper management, so it is important to be able to speak well in front of small or large crowds. In some positions, finance directors may need to identify potential fields which can be tapped for the growth of the company. This work is generally carried out in an office environment, and some travel may occasionally be required if the areas directed span multiple offices and/or branches. This is usually a full-time position."

            "Certified public accountants (CPAs) generally handle the accounting, tax, reporting and/or audit processes for governments, corporations or individual clients. Their duties may vary depending on their employer and specialization. However, tasks commonly performed by CPAs include reviewing their company's financial information; preparing documentation or reporting related to finances, taxes, or audits; and staying up-to-date on changes in government regulations. They may also perform audits for their organization, as well as make suggestions on improving bookkeeping and recordkeeping processes.",
            "CPAs usually work in an office setting with significant computer-based work. They may have to work long hours, especially during the annual tax season (January to April). CPAs may work in a variety of settings, such as larger or small accounting firms, companies in a range of industries, non-profit organizations, or local, state, or federal government agencies; they may also be self-employed. These accountants may have a specialization such as financial planning, taxes, auditing or valuation, among others.",
            "Requirements to become a CPA vary by state. A bachelor\u2019s degree with significant coursework in accounting and business administration is generally needed; these professionals also need to pass the four-part national CPA exam administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Additionally, each state has its own requirements for licensure by the state board of accountancy."

            "In general, fraud investigators work to determine whether individuals or organizations have attempted deception to realize a financial benefit. Fraud investigation applications are numerous, and so fraud investigators typically specialize in a particular field, such as insurance or accounting. The vast majority of fraud investigator work within the field of insurance, due to the high inherent potential for insurance fraud and the volume of fraud cases that occur annually.",
            "No matter the particular field, the primary duties of fraud investigators involve examining evidence, performing data analysis and interviewing involved parties in an effort to determine whether an attempt at fraud has occurred. In the insurance industry, where most fraud investigators work, the typical case begins with an informant\u2019s tip or a flag triggered by automatic computer analysis of insurance claims. The investigator then opens the case to determine whether the individual has staged events for a claim or has requested compensation for unnecessary claims.",
            "To enter the field of fraud investigation, individuals generally must possess a high school diploma or equivalent; however, companies usually give hiring preference to applicants with related experience or college-level education. In terms of work history, employers view former police officers, private investigators, and insurance adjusters favorably, as these roles are associated with interviewing and evidence analysis skills. Correspondingly, fraud investigators must be both analytically minded and excellent communicators with strong verbal abilities.",
            "Fraud investigators typically work regular business hours in an office environment, especially within the financial or insurance fields. However, some amount of fieldwork is often necessary, and investigators are occasionally required to stand as witnesses in court."

            "An equity analyst oversees a company's investments, tracking investment data and making recommendations to managers. The nature of these investments vary from industry to industry, but could include real estate, stocks, or material goods. An equity analyst must analyze market trends, identify investments that hold good return-on-investment potential, and ensure that current investments are performing as desired. These investments may be spread over a wide company portfolio, and an equity analyst must be familiar with the many different company investments. The equity analyst may oversee investments in private funds, pension funds, charitable contributions, and other types of expenditure. On a schedule determined by the company, likely quarterly, an equity analyst is required to present data  and findings to a team who will use the recommendations of the analyst to determine if any changes in company investments need to be made.",
            "The majority of employers require a minimum of five years of finance experience and prefer additional experience within the company's industry. A minimum of a bachelor's degree in finance (or a similar discipline) is required, with many companies preferring a master's degree. Additionally, certified financial analyst (CFA) certification is a basic requirement for the majority of employers.  In some industries, field-specific certifications and training may be required. An equity analyst must have strong research skills, a background in finance, and the ability to process data  to ensure that their company is making the most of existing and potential investments. Skills vital to the job include organization, an ability to process and present data, and exceptional oral and written communication skills."

Other responsibilities of an investment analyst include conducting research on funds and writing commentary or analysis, supporting advisors, delivering presentations on investment topics, and supporting asset management programs.",

They work in a professional office environment, sitting long periods of time, and using a computer for most of the day. They typically work during regular business hours, although they may need to work overtime in time-sensitive situations.",
            "A typical investment analyst is expected to work very well in a team environment. They should have outstanding communication skills to use in writing reports, collaborating with coworkers, and speaking in public. Most companies will require, at minimum, a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance, accounting, or a related field. They may also require experience in the field, certification, and/or documented progress towards certification. These certifications can include certified investment management analyst (CIMA), chartered financial analyst (CFA), or chartered alternative investment analyst (CAIA). Investment analysts are expected to have a strong sense of attention to detail, as well as to be extremely diligent and precise in their work."

            "A senior tax analyst is a management-level worker who performs a variety of tasks related to ensuring their organization complies with all tax regulations and reporting requirements. They develop compliant tax policies for the company, implements them, and generates reports on their financial impact. The senior tax analyst helps companies negotiate changing tax laws and regulations. They are expected to find the most effective ways for a company to meet its tax obligations, while also taking advantage of all opportunities related to credits and exemptions.",
            "Additionally, the senior tax analyst prepares financial reports on the impact of taxes to the company's bottom line. They forecast quarterly tax reports and  generate impact forecasts for initiatives such as expansion or buying or selling parts of the company. The senior tax analyst may arrange (and even oversee) the way the company manages taxes on wages; this typically involves working with a third party or payroll company to ensure accuracy and compliance, as well as ensure prompt reports are issued when required.",
            "A senior tax analyst generally needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in accounting, along with associated certifications such as status as a certified public accountant (CPA). Many companies prefer candidates with extensive tax backgrounds, typically in a junior position to a senior tax manager for at least two or three years. Senior tax analysts typically work in an office environment during regular business hours."

            "While many entities provide financial planning assistance to people who want a better handle on their financial situations and goals, a certified financial planner (CFP) can truly be considered a professional in the field. CFPs are only granted this title after passing a grueling certification process which ensures the individual's extensive knowledge of all aspects of the work; these include retirement planning and tax laws and regulations, as well as insurance and investment vehicles. Certified financial planners work with individuals, either under the auspices of a financial institution or in private practice, to help them manage money, income, and expenses.",
            "Certified financial planners typically begin with clients by assessing all areas of income and debt from the past and foreseeable future. They also interview clients to discover potential problem areas, as well as the financial goals the individual may hold. These goals can include saving for retirement, college expenses for children, further investments, or simply attempting to work around problems like long-term debt.",
            "CFPs work to present as many solutions and choices as possible to clients. These can include taking advantage of potential tax breaks, examining refinancing opportunities, or using different financial product packages. They also advise clients on recommended investment mixes regarding stocks, bonds, and other commodities, and may help anticipate spikes in debt or design financial shelters in case of job loss or other difficulties.",
            "A bachelor's degree may be a minimum requirement for this position, though there are also specific requirements regarding a variety of topics in insurance, investment, and market work. CFPs must also pass a rigorous two-day examination before being certified; this certification is held in high regard by financial institutions, though some CFPs choose to work independently of such organizations. These planners typically work during regular business hours in an office environment, but some will take time for irregular hours and field work to visit with potential clients in their homes."

The advisor also works to attract new clients and customers as well, marketing themselves and their financial institution\u2019s investment services.",
            "Investment advisors should fully understand the range of their company's investment strategies, vehicles, and financial products; they should also be able to determine which of these strategies would work best for variety of clients. The advisor listens to their clients, helps them understand market trends, and helps them invest money to get maximum return. This involves not only continuing education on investment and market opportunities, but also keeping track of how the client views their existing portfolios.",
            "Many financial institutions expect an investment advisor to do some amount of active marketing of his or her services. This typically involves setting up investment seminars or luncheons, presenting prospective clients with an array of investment options and demonstrating ongoing successes of existing clients. Investment advisors typically work in an office environment during regular business hours, but they may schedule occasional investment seminars for marketing purposes during the evenings as well.",
            "Many banks and institutions require financial advisors have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in business or a related field; many prefer an advanced degree such as a master's of business administration (MBA. Additionally, investment advisors must have up-to-date certifications as required by the federal and state regulations. Banks typically prefer to hire investment advisors with at least three to five years of experience in a related position."

They assess risk and either accept, reject, or modify potential policy applications.  In addition, most companies want their underwriters to help build business by seeking new potential customers that fall within the risk analysis scenario of the insurer. As such, underwriters must be able to not only think analytically, but also be able to find possible new opportunities for their organization.",
