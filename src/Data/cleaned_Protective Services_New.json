            "A police officer is part of one of the three areas of our criminal justice system. Members of the police force are responsible for enforcing the law. An officer will patrol neighborhoods to deter criminal activity as well as monitor any threat to public safety. A police officer will respond to incidents and complaints reported to the police department, document interactions with suspects, victims, and witnesses, and collect evidence at the scene of the crime. Police officers arrest offenders and suspects, collect evidence from them, and testify in court about cases in which they were involved. A member of the police force will also work with the community to coordinate community service events and outreach programs and to offer educational services to the neighborhoods the officer patrols. A police officer must complete the police academy training program, and quite often a certificate or degree in a criminal justice program is required. People applying to join the police force must pass a strict background check including their criminal history, driving record, and credit reports, in order to ensure that all members of the police force are upstanding members of society who will be a good fit with the community. A police officer must be in and remain in good physical condition, as the job may sometimes require strenuous physical activity. Hours for the position vary and are subject to changes based on the availability of other employees, and quite often a police officer will work night shifts and weekends."

            "Police investigators - also called detectives in many jurisdictions - are law enforcement professionals who typically gather and analyze evidence in felony cases. In situations where the perpetrator is unknown, the investigator works to identify and narrow down likely suspects. Because of the serious nature of many of the crimes that a police investigator handles, he or she often tries to recover sufficient evidence to help a prosecutor to secure a verdict in court. In many larger police departments, it is normal for investigators to specialize in areas such as vehicular theft, cyber crime or homicides. Regardless of the specific assignments or crimes, however, many duties are the same; the investigator helps collect and analyze crime scene evidence, interviews witnesses and persons of interest, and documents all aspects of the case until an arrest is made.",
            "Within a law enforcement department, a police investigator is typically promoted from the ranks of patrol officers, usually after extensive testing and exams. Many prospective investigators obtain training in criminology or a related field from a vocational school, community college or university. Police investigators must have an excellent ability to spot details, strong interpersonal skills and an understanding of human communication, as he or she likely interviews individuals who may be hostile to questioning and who might reveal important information. An investigator must also be able to work well in a team setting and on their own. Investigators tend to work long hours and may have irregular shift schedules; they typically spend time in the field and in an office environment."

Strong computer, research, and report-writing skills are generally required in order to carry out searches, maintain communication with employers and co-workers, and present findings to the appropriate parties. Strong written and verbal communication skills and problem-solving skills are also important.",

All information acquired should be classified and kept confidential as necessary. Those in this position must be familiar with the necessary analysis tools and automated systems like databases, imagery analysis, and signal intelligence, and some jobs require intelligence analysts to have reached a certain level of security clearance. Aspiring intelligence analysts should receive training from an intelligence collection and analysis school and earn the proper certification. A bachelor\u2019s degree in a relevant field may also be a minimum requirement, though some employers will hire those with significant prior experience in place of a degree."

            "In an airport or at a border crossing, a customs officer often works mostly with people entering the country. In these situations, the officer checks documentation and passports to determine that a person may legally enter. Typically, the officer assesses each person's identification, asks routine questions about the purpose of the visit and asks if the traveler has any items that he or she would like to declare. Some customs officers may work with contraband crews that include drug detection mechanisms such as  specially trained animals. Customs officers also check manifests of international shipping operations. Cargo must be fully disclosed and declared along its shipping route, and customs officers may perform routine inspections of arriving freight, matching it to the provided manifests before clearing and quarantining it for pickup and shipment to its end destination.",
            "Customs officers typically undergo training that incorporates aspects of customer service and problem solving, as well as knowledge of the law and enforcement procedures. There are specialized vocational and technical schools that provide this training and perform the necessary background checks that officers need to provide in the application process."

            "Loss prevention officers help ensure that their company does not lose merchandise or goods through theft or other means. Basic day-to-day tasks include regular patrols in the field, completion of activity and incident reports, and the maintenance of security equipment. Depending on the size of the company, interaction with a team of other officers may occur; all positions require communication with managers and customers on a regular basis. Some companies require safety training prior to taking the position, both for handling accidents and for protecting company assets. Attention to detail and the ability to carefully follow company policies and requirements at all times are crucial to success in these positions.",
            "Risks at the job are generally minimal, though stressful situations may occur and will require quick thinking and strong judgment skills. Most work is performed in an indoor environment, although some positions require outdoor patrols. Hours vary depending on the needs of their company, with some positions including overnight shifts and others limited to regular business operating hours. Positions as a loss prevention officer are available at a wide variety of retail locations ranging from local stores to more specialized environments such as hotels.",
            "Job requirements are generally minimal for most openings, with basic requirements including a high school diploma or equivalent and experience with alarm systems. The job also has some physical requirements, such as vision and hearing, as well as the ability to sit, stand, or walk for extended periods of time. In addition to this, communication skills and basic computer skills are necessary to complete reports."

            "In particularly difficult and dangerous situations involving armed criminals, the normal levels of manpower and firepower may be inadequate. Large cities often have special paramilitary units which are trained in high-risk tactical action to be deployed in such circumstances, and these units are called SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics). A SWAT team member is an individual who is assigned to such a squad and trained in the use of weapons such as assault and sniper rifles and, occasionally, special vehicles such as helicopters and armored personnel carriers.",
            "SWAT officers must be physically fit and mentally sharp and understand standard infiltration tactics, crowd control practices, and hostage situations. As the name indicates, SWAT officers are trained in the use of weapons, armor, and equipment that regular police officers do not typically utilize. They must also be effective communicators, and it is essential that they function well as a part of a team. As they are often sent to conduct operations in dangerous situations and under a lot of stress, the bar is set high both in fitness and performance. It is just as important that SWAT officers are skilled marksmen as they are effective at receiving and executing orders, and only the most capable applicants are accepted.",
            "Most SWAT team members begin their careers as regular police officers. Indeed, at least three years of police work may be a minimum requirement for this position, though applicants who have military experience often receive special consideration. Some police forces may prefer applicants who have an associate's or bachelor's degree in criminal justice."
